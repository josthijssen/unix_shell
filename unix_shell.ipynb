    "# The unix shell\n",
    "\n",
    "## What, why and how?\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is a program which shields off the (gory details of) the operating system from you.\n",
    "Examples: DOS shell, Unix shells: sh, csh, tcsh, bash\n",
    "\n",
    "> We shall be focusing on bash (Bourne Again SHell)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we care about the shell?\n",
    "1. It is behind sooooooooo many things\n",
    "2. You can use it from within a python or C program\n",
    "3. It facilitates complex and repetitive tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "> Apple also has unix-like shells. Details may be different for Mac.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The shell is accessible when you open a terminal. Basically you type in the terminal and the shell shows its output in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> From the Jupyter control panel: open terminal to directly access the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once you're inside the terminal, you're on the CLI (Command Line Interface). Most systems also have a GUI (Graphical User interface).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "They form a tree-structure (Inspect using `tree`)\n",
    "- A *directory* is a container for files and/or subdirectories\n",
    "- A *file* is a container for information (bytes) which is handled as a single unit\n",
    "- The *path* is the location of a file\n",
    "- The *absolute path* gives you the location with respect to the root '/' of the directory tree\n",
    "- The *relative path* gives you the location with respect to the *current* collection\n",
    "> Examples:     \n",
    "       `onderwijs/colleges/CasimirComputerCourse`     \n",
    " (This is a relative path; I am in `/home/jost`  This is my *home directory*)\n",

    "        mkdir /home/jost/my_new_dir \n",
    "\n",
    "        mkdir my_new_dir\n",
    "5. Remove directory: `rmdir ~/my_new_dir` (`my_new_dir` should be empty!)\n",
    "6. Copy files: `cp file1 file2` or `cp file1 subdir/file2` or `cp file1 subdir/`\n",
    "7. Move files/directories: `mv src dest`. This is also used for renaming.\n",
    "8. Files have *permissions*: read (r), write (w) and execute (x). These permissions can be different for different users: the *owner* (o), the members of the same user group as the owner (g) or everybody (w)\n",
